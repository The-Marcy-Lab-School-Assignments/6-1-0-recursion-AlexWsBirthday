# Question

What are the benefits of writing functions recursively? What are the drawbacks?

# Answer
PROS: Recursion is easier to read due to simplicity vs. an iterative approach, very good for tree and graph traversals using memoization 

CONS: Takes up space more memory (because of the calls added to the callstack), risk of stack overflow (if base case is forgotten), sometimes not as efficient as an iterative approach
