# Question

What is a recursive function? What are "cases" that exist in recursive functions?

# Answer
A recursive function is merely a function that calls itself, within itself. The 'cases' that exist within recursive functions are:

1. The _base case_ - a condition which stops the recursion at a certain point so the recursion doesn't go in an infinite loop and case __stack overflow__.

2. the _recursive case_ - the part of the function that makes it a recursionâ€” the part where the function calls itself.
